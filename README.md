- 👋 Hi, I’m @dbrand-dataops
- 👀 I’m interested in writing, engineering and coding for data operations.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to create python notebooks that manage code on a linux server in Azure which process data for a PostgreSQL database in Azure that is analysed in powerBI.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment.
